# nate-gillman.github.io

This is the repo for my academic website. 

Attribution (and thanks) are due to Srinath Sridhar, who kindly let me cannibalize his website ([https://github.com/drsrinathsridhar/homepage](https://github.com/drsrinathsridhar/homepage))

Notes to self: 

1. Currently, this repo is hosted at [https://cs.brown.edu/people/ngillman/](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ngillman/). These files are stored under Brown's file system, which I can access via ```ssh ngillman@ssh.cs.brown.edu``` and ```cd /web/cs/web/people/ngillman```.
2. In order to switch it back so that the repo is hosted on github through nategillman.com, I need to use the DNS settings that I screenshotted and put under the /images folder, and also put nategillman.com inside a CNAME document in the repo.
3. To get the file permissions correct on Brown's file system, execute ```chmod -R ugo+rX .```
